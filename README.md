# DesignPatterns in Java

This repository contains clean and simple Java examples of common design patterns, including exercises and a mini-project.

## Repository Structure

```
DesignPatterns/
├── Exercise1/
│   └── Design-Pattern/
├── Exercise2/
│   └── Mini-Project/
└── README.md
```

* **Exercise1/Design-Pattern**: Basic pattern examples and their usage.
* **Exercise2/Mini-Project**: A small project combining multiple patterns.

## How It Works

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SURIYA-PRAKASH-E-S/DesignPatterns.git
   cd DesignPatterns
   ```

2. **Explore the Exercises**:

   * **Exercise1**: Contains individual examples of design patterns. Navigate to the `Exercise1/Design-Pattern` directory to see each pattern implemented in Java.

   * **Exercise2**: A mini-project that integrates multiple design patterns. Go to the `Exercise2/Mini-Project` directory to explore the combined implementation.

3. **Run the Examples**:

   For each exercise, you can compile and run the Java files using the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```
   Replace `FileName` with the name of the Java file you wish to run.
