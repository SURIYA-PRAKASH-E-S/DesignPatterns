# Console-Based Real-Time Chat System

##  Topic
A simple **console-based real-time chat system** in Java, built with **OOP principles and design patterns** (Observer, Singleton, Adapter).

---
## Problem Statement
Build a console-based real-time chat application where users can create or join chat rooms using a unique ID. Users must be able to send/receive messages instantly, view active participants, and optionally use private messaging and message history

##  Description
This project demonstrates how to build a **multi-user chat system** in Java using sockets.  
It allows users to join or create chat rooms, send messages, view active users, and access chat history.
It focuses on logic, OOP, and design quality rather than UI, making it a practical example of applying software engineering principles to real-time communication.  

*Focus areas:*
- **Observer Pattern**: Notify all clients in a room of new events.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Manage chat rooms globally.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Abstract communication layer for extensibility.
- **OOP & SOLID**: Encapsulation, modularity, extensibility.

---

##  Functionality
1. Users can **create/join chat rooms** with unique IDs.
2. **Send and receive** real-time public messages.
3. Display list of **active users**.
4. **Private messaging** between users.(`/pm`)
5. **Message history** replay on joining a room.
6. **Private message history** available (`/pmh`).

---

##  Code Flow & Components

1. **ChatServer**  
   - Accepts client connections.  
   - Spawns `ClientHandler` threads.

2. **ClientHandler** (Adapter + Observer)  
   - Parses client commands.  
   - Forwards messages to `ChatRoom`.  
   - Adapts socket I/O via `MessageSender`.

3. **ChatRoom** (Observer Subject)  
   - Holds active users.  
   - Broadcasts system/public/private messages.  
   - Stores public and private message history.

4. **ChatRoomManager** (Singleton)  
   - Ensures global state of rooms.  
   - Thread-safe with eager initialization.

5. **ChatClient**  
   - Console-based client interface.  
   - Sends commands, displays incoming messages asynchronously.

6. **Message**  
   - Immutable model class.  
   - Formats messages consistently.

##  How to Execute Code
1. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Start server (default port 9090):
  ```bash
  java ChatServer 9090
  ```
3. Start clients (in separate terminals):
  ```bash
  java ChatClient localhost 9090
  ```
4. Use commands:

- `/jn` <roomId> <username> ‚Üí join room

- `/msg` <text> ‚Üí send public message

- `/pm` <user> <text> ‚Üí send private message

- `/u` ‚Üí list active users

- `/h` ‚Üí view public history

- `/pmh` <user> ‚Üí view private history with user

- `/q` ‚Üí quit
